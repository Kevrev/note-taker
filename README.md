# Note Taker

## Description

This application enables users to create and save notes. Users can view previously saved notes and delete notes they no longer need. Express.js is and a db.json file are used to save and retrieve note data. If the repository is cloned to a local device, users can see how there data is stored in the db.json file and they can manually edit the file to add or delete notes.

## Usage

After navigating to the deployed application, users can enter the note taking page by clicking the get started button. Clicking that button will take the user to the notes page where they can begin creating new notes. Users need not initially use the "+" symbol to create new notes, it is only required to navigate back to new note creation when the user is currently viewing a saved note. Users can begin creating the new note by typing in the empty note title and note body areas. Clicking the icon next to the "+" symbol, which only appears when changes have been made, will save this note as a new note. Clicking on a note from the side will display the note's title and body in the main note area. Clicking the trash can icon will delete the note from the database and the page.
